    <h1>Lasagne</h1>

        This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne by the Bolognese Chamber 
        of Commerce, with a few tweaks inspired by locals—adjusting the meat, wine, 
        and whether to add milk. One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential. 
        The ragù is simple, with no garlic, herbs, or spices. Fresh pasta eliminates the 
        need for pre-boiling.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium brown onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>600g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled, grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp no added salt tomato paste</li>
        <li>400g can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano leaves</li>
        <li>1 quantity Fresh wholemeal pasta (see related recipe)</li>
        <li>60g baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups grated light mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring 
            occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes or until softened. Increase heat to medium-high. 
            Add mince. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up mince, for 5 minutes or until browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add carrot and tomato paste to mince mixture. Stir to combine. Add tomato, oregano 
            and 1/4 cup cold water. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes 
            or until sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan-forced. Meanwhile, make pasta (see related recipe), 
            trimming sheets to make eight 20cm x 10cm pieces. Lightly grease a 6cm-deep, 20cm square 
            ceramic baking dish. Arrange 2 pieces of pasta over base of dish. Spread one-third of the 
            mince mixture over pasta. Top with one-third of the spinach. Top with 2 pasta pieces. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with half the remaining mince and half the remaining spinach. Top with 2 pasta pieces. 
            Sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Repeat with remaining mince and spinach. Finish with 2 pasta pieces 
            and remaining cheese. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until cheese is golden and melted. Stand for 10 minutes. Serve.
